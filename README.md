This project explores improving the behaviour of entities in a team based environment using a messenger system
We were given a base project to work from in this assignment which consisted of the shell code for the messaging system and the game itself.

Our task was to implement some entity behaviour in the form of a finite state machine that was controlled by a messaging system.
On top of this we were tasked with enhancing the user interface to display details about each of the individual entities.
The project was converted from hard coded entity instantiation to the use of XML files to import and setup the scene.

If available, a link to a video demonstrating the project can be found in another text file located in the repositary.
